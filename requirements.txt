# NOTE(david, toshi): Directly use our own fork of Flask-Potion to remove a bug
# where flask potion tries to incorrectly infer the response schemas from type
# annotaions. Flask-Potion is no longer under active devleopment.
# NOTE(abby): Flask Potion is needed for both the web server and the pipeline due
# to alerts code. If alerts code is ever moved out of the pipeline, then revert
# this.
