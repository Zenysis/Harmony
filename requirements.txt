# On M1, with PyPy running native, 1.21.0 can't install.
# I change to `numpy==1.21.0` (not exlusions) and ran:
# CPPFLAGS=-I[location of Python.h for your pypy install] pypy3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# NOTE: Directly use our own fork of Flask-Potion to remove a bug
# where flask potion tries to incorrectly infer the response schemas from type
# annotations. Flask-Potion is no longer under active devleopment.
# NOTE: Flask Potion is needed for both the web server and the pipeline due
# to alerts code. If alerts code is ever moved out of the pipeline, then revert
# this.
