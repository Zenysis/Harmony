This is the directory that will store all query related models for the indicator
db, such as field, dimension, pipeline data source. This is currently a work in
progress and not used for any production code.
This will eventually replace many of the 'aqt' (advanced query tool - named
this way because we previously had a standard query tool version) models in
data/query/models/.
