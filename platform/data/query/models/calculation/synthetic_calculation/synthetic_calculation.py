    '''A SyntheticCalculation computes its final value post-query. It can add
    calculations to the Druid query like other Calculation types, but the result value
    it produces must be computed post-query using the query result dataframe.

    NOTE: A known limitation of SyntheticCalculations right now is that it
    can only produce a single series at the end. An advantage of this is that it makes
    the value calculation simpler to reason about: an input dataframe comes in, an
    output dataframe is returned. However, there might be some calculations that need to
    produce multiple values (like forecast and forecast error). These should probably be
    separate Fields, however you wouldn't want to calculate forecast values twice to
    get the result.
