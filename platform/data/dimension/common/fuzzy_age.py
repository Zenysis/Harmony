    '''
    Represents a 'fuzzy' age that allows one to define an absolute time interval
    using years and months but also results in a precision loss owing to the fact
    that time representation using years and months no longer represents an absolute
    point in time unless a reference date is provided.

    e.g.
    4 years, 2 months from '2016-10-24 00:00:00' represents an absolute point in time
    4 years, 2 months without a reference date does not represent an absolute point in time

    This is owing to the existence of leap years and the divergent lengths of time that one
    month represents.

    If years and months are not specified and time is only represented in hours and days,
    there will be virtually no precision loss due to the effectively non-variant nature
    of the length of a day/hour.
