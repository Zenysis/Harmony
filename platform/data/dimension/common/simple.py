# Simple dimension types are representable as a simple key to string dimension
# value mapping.
# To create a new simple dimension, subclass SimpleDimension and assign
# class level attributes like you would an enum. Behind the scenes at class
# creation time, the attribute values will be converted from a string into
# an object of that class's type from that string.

# Example:
# The written class definition
#     class Gender(SimpleDimension):
#         MALE = 'Male'
#         FEMALE = 'Female'
#
# is transformed into
#     class Gender(SimpleDimension):
#         MALE = Gender('Male')
#         FEMALE = Gender('Female')
#
# The stored attributes are now subclasses of SimpleDimension (which is a
# subclass of BaseDimension) and support the features of the parent class
# allowing Gender.MALE.get_dimension_value() to work.

# Return all attributes attached to a class object excluding methods and
# private class variables. This is a fairly simple test, so there are most
# likely edge cases that are not handled. It is ok for our purposes
