This directory contains generic interfaces that perform a single purpose. They
are not constrained to usage on only ZenModels or normal classes, and they should
not be coupled to specific complex behavior. Good candidates should be simple,
provide a small number of properties or methods, and should encapsulate a single
idea. When adding an interface to this directory, consider how widely usable it
is and whether the methods and properties on the interface are always needed.
If not, then that interface should be stored much closer to the code it is
coupled to.
