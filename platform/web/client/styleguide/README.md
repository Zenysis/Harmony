This directory includes important files to make our styleguide work.

**Running our styleguide**
`yarn styleguide` will start up our styleguide. If you go to http://localhost:6060/ you'll be able to see examples for all our UI components.

NOTE: The code in web/client/styleguide is not included in our webpack bundle. It is only used by styleguidist. It is loaded in styleguide.config.js.
