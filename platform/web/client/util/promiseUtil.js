/**
 * The UncancellablePromise will prevent any Promise cancellation event from
 * reaching the stored promise. This is particularly useful for expensive
 * network calls that are going to be cached (like retrieving a dataset). In
 * those times, it is preferred to allow the network call to complete (and any
 * post-processing to happen) instead of having the initial promise get
 * cancelled and start over again.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   Construct a promise that you do not want to be cancelled. Every time the
 *   UncancellablePromise is used, this promise will be the first one resolved.
 *     const innerPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
 *     const uncancellablePromise = UncancellablePromise.create(innerPromise);
 *
 *   When you want to chain off this uncancellable promise, call the `use`
 *   method.
 *     return uncancellablePromise.use();
