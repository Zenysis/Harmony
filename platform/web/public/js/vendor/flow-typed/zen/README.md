This directory holds type annotations developed internally at Zenysis for vendor libraries or APIs.

For the most part these type annotations are incomplete and only cover our codebase's needs. If we ever do fully type annotate a library or an API, we should consider open-sourcing those annotations to flow or flow-typed.
