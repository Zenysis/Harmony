def authentication_required(is_api_request=False, force_authentication=False):
    '''
    A decorator that enforces that the currently loaded be authenticated prior
    to calling the underlying method. If the public access has been enabled as
    defined by getting the value of `PUBLIC_ACCESS_KEY` from the Configuration Store,
    the decorator will no longer enforce the authentication requirement.

    Parameters
    ----------
    is_api_request (optional): boolean
        Indicates whether or not this decorator is being used for an API route or a UI route.
        If set to `True`, an exception is thrown instead of invoking the
        `unauthenticated_view_function`.

    force_authentication (optional): boolean
        Indicates whether or not this decorator will respect the value for the public access
        setting or not. If set to `True`, the decorator will not allow the underlying operation
        to be run unless the user has logged in as a registered user.

    Returns
    -------
    func
        A function that directs the user to the unauthenticated view function
        if the user is unauthenticated or returns the value from the underlying
        function call if the user is unauthorized and `is_api_request` is set to `False`.

    Raises
    -------
    werkzeug.exceptions.Forbidden
        In the event that the user is not authorized to perform the operation and `is_api_request`
        is set to `True`.
