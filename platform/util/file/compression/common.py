# The command line compressor and decompressors make it easy to expose system
# compression binaries in python. A named pipe is created and exposed as a
# normal file object, and a background process handles compression or
# decompression through this pipe. A regular python file object will be yielded
# to the caller and can be used like normal (just without seeking).
#
# Here is an example using the gzip library:
# rows = ['hello', 'world']
# with CommandLineCompressor('/tmp/test.txt.gz', 'gzip -5') as output_file:
#     for row in rows:
#         output_file.write(row)
#         output_file.write('\n')
#
# with CommandLineDecompressor('gunzip -c /tmp/test.txt.gz') as input_file:
#     for line in input_file:
#         print line

# Execute the provided compression command and store the output in the specified
# output file. The compression command should be setup to read from stdin.
# NOTE: Using a contextmanager decorator since we want to return
# a full file object to be used by the caller.
