# This LZ4 utility uses the system provided LZ4 library for compression
# and decompression. Each command returns a context managed object that
# exposes a normal python file for reading/writing.
# Example usage:
#
# rows = ['hello', 'world']
# with LZ4Writer('/tmp/test_file.lz4') as output_file:
#     for row in rows:
#         output_file.write(row)
#         output_file.write('\n')
#
# with LZ4Reader('/tmp/test_file.lz4') as input_file:
#     for line in input_file:
#         print line
