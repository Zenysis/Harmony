# right before it is sent to the server. There are very few cases where this
# type of query is needed. If you think that you have a specific type of
# query that will need this behavior, you MUST talk to @stephen before
# implementing it. These aggregations can have broad side effects that are
# very hard to debug. They should almost never be used.
